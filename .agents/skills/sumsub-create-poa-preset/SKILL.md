# Sumsub — Create POA Preset

Builds a POA preset JSON payload from a compact spec, POSTs it to the Sumsub API, and reports the resulting preset `id` so it can be attached to one or more levels via `level.requiredIdDocs.docSets[].poaStepSettingsId`.

> **Prerequisite — level must have a PROOF_OF_RESIDENCE step.** A POA preset has no effect unless it is attached to a `PROOF_OF_RESIDENCE` (or `PROOF_OF_RESIDENCE2`/`3`/`4`) docset in at least one level. If the user hasn't created (or described) a level that includes a POA step, surface this before building the preset — there is no point creating it in isolation.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | When |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/resources/api/poaStepSettings` | Create a new preset. Body MUST NOT include `id` — server assigns it. |
| `PATCH` | `/resources/api/poaStepSettings` | Update an existing preset. Body MUST include `id` (the field, not in the URL). |
| `GET` | `/resources/api/poaStepSettings/{id}` | Read one preset back — used to verify what landed and to resolve `name` from a known `id`. |

All three require permission `manageClientSettings`. Body shape is the
[POA preset schema](references/poa-preset-schema.md) — client-settable
fields only (`clientId`, `createdAt`, `createdBy`, `modifiedAt`, audit
trail are server-managed and echoed back on the response).

After creation, attach by editing a level: `requiredIdDocs.docSets[].poaStepSettingsId = "<the new id>"` on any `PROOF_OF_RESIDENCE` doc-set.

## Auth — App Token + secret (sandbox only)

This skill talks to the public Sumsub API and signs each request per
[the authentication reference](https://docs.sumsub.com/reference/authentication).
The full how-it-works writeup lives in the [`sumsub-api-auth`](../sumsub-api-auth/SKILL.md)
skill — read it if you hit `401 Invalid signature`.

> **⚠️ Sandbox tokens only.** Do **not** accept or use a production App Token
> here. If the user offers one, refuse and ask them to generate a sandbox
> pair at <https://cockpit.sumsub.com/checkus/devSpace/appTokens> (toggle
> the workspace to **Sandbox** first, then **Create**). Token + secret are
> shown once — copy both before closing the dialog. The helper script
> enforces this — it rejects tokens that don't start with `sbx:`.

| Var | Example |
|---|---|
| `SUMSUB_APP_TOKEN` | `sbx:...` — sandbox App Token from the dashboard. |
| `SUMSUB_SECRET_KEY` | The paired secret shown once at token creation. |
| `SUMSUB_BASE` | Optional. Defaults to `https://api.sumsub.com`. |

If the user has already supplied credentials in conversation, reuse them;
otherwise ask once before running. Never echo the secret back.

## Tenant entitlements

POA preset creation has historically been gated behind the `POA` entitlement, but **in practice the API accepts the write for most tenants regardless** — the entitlement is often baseline, covered by other keys, or simply not surfaced in `allowedChecks`. Don't treat its absence as a blocker.

1. Invoke `sumsub-check-permissions` and inspect `allowedChecks` — informational, for diagnostics.
2. **If `POA` is present** — proceed.
3. **If `POA` is missing** — proceed anyway, with a one-line user-visible note that the documented entitlement isn't listed (so they know what to mention to support if the POST eventually fails). Do NOT pause for confirmation — Sumsub will reject the write itself if the tenant truly lacks the right, and the 4xx from that will be more informative than a pre-emptive halt.
4. **If the POST returns a 4xx that mentions an entitlement** — surface the error body verbatim and suggest contacting CSM / Sumsub support.

## Procedure

0. **Fetch tenant entitlements** — see section above.
1. **Translate the user's intent into the compact spec** (below). Most users describe presets in terms of "what we accept" (bank statements, utility bills) and "for how long" (validity in months) — map that into `providers` keys, `subTypes`, and `validMonths`.
2. **Validate**: name non-empty; `includedCountries` and `excludedCountries` aren't both set; every provider key is a `PoaCompanyContactType`; every `subTypes` entry is a `PoaSubType`; every country code is ISO-3166-1 alpha-3 uppercase; `crossValidator.fuzzyThreshold` in `[0, 1]`.
3. **Generate payload** via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_poa_preset.py` (compact spec on stdin → full payload on stdout).
4. **Create vs. update**:
   - **New preset** — POST via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/post_poa_preset.sh`. The payload must **not** carry `id`.
   - **Update existing** — first GET the current state via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/get_poa_preset.sh` so the user sees the diff, then PATCH via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/patch_poa_preset.sh`. The payload must include the preset's `id`.
5. **Build the dashboard link.** Read `id` and `clientId` from the response body and format:

   ```
   https://cockpit.sumsub.com/checkus/sdkIntegrations/globalSettings/userVerification/proofOfAddress/<id>?clientId=<clientId>&xSNSEnv=sbx
   ```

   The `xSNSEnv=sbx` query param targets the **Sandbox** workspace — it is the canonical sandbox link param shared across all skills.
6. **Report** — lead with the human-readable name; surface the id only at the end as the value to pass into the next API call:
   - **Name** and country scope (incl/excl) + per-country override countries.
   - A brief summary of what's accepted (provider types covered, default validity).
   - **Dashboard link** as a clickable markdown link.
   - Final line: `Preset ID for level wiring: <id>`.

### Address types (`addressTypes[]`)

`dwelling`, `poBox`, `poBoxSpecialCountries`.

### POI-as-POA `allowedTypes[]`

Standard `IdDocType` values: `PASSPORT`, `ID_CARD`, `RESIDENCE_PERMIT`, `DRIVERS` (others rare).

### Name comparison modes (`crossValidator.nameMode`)

`strict`, `weakContainment`, `def`, `ai`, `fuzzy`, `containment`, `fuzzyContainment`.

### Address comparison modes (`crossValidator.addressMode`)

`strict`, `fuzzy`.

## Outputs

On success, lead with the human-readable info:
- `name`, country scope, list of per-country override countries.
- A brief summary (provider types covered, default validity).
- **Dashboard link**: `https://cockpit.sumsub.com/checkus/sdkIntegrations/globalSettings/userVerification/proofOfAddress/<id>?clientId=<clientId>&xSNSEnv=sbx`. Render as a clickable markdown link. Both `id` and `clientId` come from the POST response body; `xSNSEnv=sbx` targets the Sandbox workspace.
- Finally, on its own line: `Preset ID (for level wiring / future PATCH): <id>`.

On failure: HTTP status + Sumsub's `description`/`errorName`. The builder rejects invalid enums / impossible combinations upfront with precise messages.

### Names, not ids, in user-facing messages

This applies to **every** message about the preset — pre-POST summary, mid-flow status updates, hand-off lines — not only the final report:

- Refer to the preset by `name` ("POA — 60 days"), not by its `id`, in prose.
- The `id` belongs only on the final dedicated line (`Preset ID for level wiring: <id>`) — that line is the one place a raw id is correct, because the user needs to copy it into a level's `poaPresetId`.
- When the caller is the level skill chaining this preset into a `PROOF_OF_RESIDENCE` step, the level skill should ALSO refer to this preset by name in its pre-POST summary — see [`sumsub-create-level`](../sumsub-create-level/SKILL.md#names-not-ids-in-user-facing-messages).

### Hand-off to `sumsub-create-level`

The returned `id` is what you pass to a level's `PROOF_OF_RESIDENCE` doc-set. The level skill exposes it as a friendly `poaPresetId` shortcut (or the canonical `poaStepSettingsId`):

```json
{
  "type": "PROOF_OF_RESIDENCE",
  "docTypes": ["UTILITY_BILL", "BANK_STATEMENT"],
  "poaPresetId": "<id from this skill>"
}
```

See [`sumsub-create-level/examples/with-presets.json`](../sumsub-create-level/examples/with-presets.json).

## Worked examples

- [`examples/minimal.json`](examples/minimal.json) — bare-minimum preset: 6-month bank/utility/gov defaults, POI-as-POA off.
- [`examples/eu-bank-friendly.json`](examples/eu-bank-friendly.json) — EU-only preset, generous bank-statement validity, POI-as-POA allowed for 3 months.
- [`examples/per-country-tight.json`](examples/per-country-tight.json) — global defaults plus a tighter Brazil override.

## Cross-skill dependency

`scripts/patch_poa_preset.sh` reuses the signing helper `sumsub_request.py`
from the **sumsub-create-cross-check-preset** skill (3-arg interface:
`METHOD PATH PAYLOAD`). The path is overridable via the `SUMSUB_REQUEST_HELPER`
env var (default points at the sibling skill's copy), so a directory move won't
break the PATCH path. If you relocate either skill, set `SUMSUB_REQUEST_HELPER`
to the helper's absolute path. (`post_`/`get_` scripts here use direct `curl`
and have no such dependency.)
